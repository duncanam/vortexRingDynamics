### Description

### Usage
The simulation and plotting code for this project is fairly simple. First, make sure that you have Python 3 installed properly. Next, adjust the input parameters on lines 30-40 of "rings.py" (this is the script that performs the simulation). Save the file. To run, open a terminal window, navigate to the folder containing this submission on type "python rings.py" - the simulations should now run be visible on your screen. If the simulation runs slowly, try adjustinng the "tStep" and "displayValue" variables, as these will change the time step of the simulation and how often the plots are updated.
