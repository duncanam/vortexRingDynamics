NOTES FROM OFFICE HOURS


First, get the self propulsion due to ONE ring working

Vinduced = Gamma*4*pi* integral(eW x x-x')/(x-x')^3


theta' is location around the circle that you are summing the effects at?

x = [Rcos(theta)   Rsin(theta)   z]

x' = [Rcos(theta') Rsin(theta') z']

eW = "e-omega" = [sin(theta') cos(theta') 0]

V = integral from 0 to 2*pi (from before * R')dtheta'

---> "integrate along theta'"


inducedVelocity(Gamma,R,R',z,z', timeStep?,rotationDirections?)
